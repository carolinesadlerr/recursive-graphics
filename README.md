# Recursive Graphics
#Recursive functions using l-systems for the Koch Snowflake, Hilbert Curve, Sierpinski Triangle, Dragon Curve, Sierpinski Curve and Koch Curve.
##l-system-plotter.py is a python file used to visualize the C++ files. This is where the l-system commands are read and instruct a "turtle" to move and draw a line creating the fractal. In order to use this file you must import
##Koch Snowflake

##Hilbert Curve

#Sierpinski Triangle

##Dragon Curve

##Sierpinski Curve

#Koch Curve
