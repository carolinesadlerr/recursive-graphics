# Recursive Graphics
#Recursive functions using l-systems for the Koch Snowflake, Hilbert Curve, Sierpinski Triangle, Dragon Curve, Sierpinski Curve and Koch Curve.
##l-system-plotter.py## 
This is a python file used to visualize the C++ files. This is where the l-system commands are read and instruct a "turtle" to move and draw a line creating the fractal. In   order to use this file you must import matplotlib as mpl, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, import matplotlib.colors as mcolors. In addition, import sys, from math import pi, sin, cos, and from math import isnan. In order the run this and output a file you must enter: python3 l-system-plotter.py l-system.txt <output file name> <degree of turn>.
